### How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

Answer:
I spent about 10 minutes looking at the just-eat website to see how it works and what HTML code looks like.
I spent about 1 hour setting up the environment.
I spent about 1 writing original tests and then 20 minutes to convert them to Gherkin syntax.

If I had more time I would think about the test data to avoid test failing if data changes.


### What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

Answer: The trend is now towards developers writing their own e2e tests. I think that the person who wrote a piece of code is responsible for making sure it is tested correctly.

There are many new automation frameworks out there which means that the industry is actively trying to address problems with automation.


### How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

Answer: If possible to modify existing code then I would add custom ids to make it easier to find elements. If not then one must struggle with xpath.

### How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

Answer: I found their site a bit slow and it reloads entire content between pages.
